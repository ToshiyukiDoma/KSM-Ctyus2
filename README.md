# KSM-Ctyus2
Cytus 2-inspired skin for kshootmania.

I don't really know how to replicate make the note/laser effects to this game as I'm having a hard time with it. Other than the listed, I could say that this skin is complete.

## Difference from common skins
- I made a different texture for the BT, BT Holds, FX, and FX Holds.

## To do list:
- [ ] Course-related part of the game's skin
- [ ] Options Screen
- [ ] Note/Laser Explosions

## Extra:
You can change the difficulty images. It's available on the 'imgs/customize' folder.
